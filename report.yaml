product_narrative: |
  How many of you have regrets about taking a bad elective before? It is frustrating and draining for students to waste time on bad classes especially when it can be avoided. We view this as a lack of transparency with the university course review system. That is why we want to create CourseRaider, a platform for students to share course reviews with other students that are similar to you.
